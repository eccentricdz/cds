## Parameters

The `useMergeRefs` hook accepts a spread of refs as its parameter:

- `...refs: (React.MutableRefObject<T> | React.LegacyRef<T> | undefined | null)[]` - An array of refs to merge. Can include:
  - `MutableRefObject` - Object-based refs created with `useRef`
  - `LegacyRef` - Function-based refs or string refs (legacy)
  - `undefined` or `null` - Optional refs that might not be provided

</MDXArticle>

## Returns

Returns a `React.RefCallback<T>` function that can be used as a ref:

- The returned callback handles updating all provided refs when the referenced element changes
- Properly handles both object-based and function-based refs
- Safely handles undefined or null refs by ignoring them

:::tip
This hook is particularly useful when working with components that need to combine multiple refs, such as when using both forwarded refs and internal state refs, or when composing components that each require their own ref.
